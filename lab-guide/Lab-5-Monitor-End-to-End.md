# Lab 5:  Monitor Applications End-to-End (Optional)

### Estimated Duration: 40 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore live application metrics and query logs to know the health of your applications.

## Lab Objectives

- Task 1: Add Instrumentation Key to Key Vault
- Task 2: Update Sampling Rate
- Task 3: Reload Applications
- Task 4: Get the log stream for an application
- Task 5: Start monitoring apps and dependencies - in Application Insights
- Task 6: Start monitoring ACME Fitness Store's logs and metrics in Azure Log Analytics

### Task 1: Add Instrumentation Key to Key Vault

1. The Application Insights Instrumentation Key must be provided for the non-java applications.

   > **Note:** In future iterations, the build packs for non-java applications will support Application Insights binding, and this step will be unnecessary.

2. To retrieve the Instrumentation Key for Application Insights and add it to the Key Vault, run the following command in the Git Bash window. Replace azure-spring-apps-SUFFIX with your **azure-spring-apps-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** and the $RESOURCE_GROUP with **Modernize-java-apps**

      ```shell
         export INSTRUMENTATION_KEY=$(az monitor app-insights component show --app azure-spring-apps-SUFFIX --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP | jq -r '.connectionString')
      
         az keyvault secret set --vault-name ${KEY_VAULT} \
            --name "ApplicationInsights--ConnectionString" --value ${INSTRUMENTATION_KEY}
      ```

      > **Note:** You can ignore any warning related to extension application insights.

### Task 2: Update Sampling Rate

1. To increase the sampling rate for the Application Insights binding, run the following command in the Git Bash pane:

      ```shell
      az spring build-service builder buildpack-binding set \
          --builder-name default \
          --name default \
          --type ApplicationInsights \
          --properties sampling-rate=100 connection_string=${INSTRUMENTATION_KEY}
      ```

      > **Note:** The above command could take up to **15-20** minutes to complete. Please wait until it runs successfully. Meanwhile, you can learn more about sampling in application insights by clicking [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/sampling?tabs=net-core-new).

### Task 3: Reload Applications

1. Run the following command to restart applications to reload the configuration. (For the Java applications, this will allow the new sampling rate to take effect. For non-java applications, this will allow them to access the Instrumentation Key from the Key Vault.)

      ```shell
         az spring app restart -n ${CART_SERVICE_APP}
         az spring app restart -n ${ORDER_SERVICE_APP}
         az spring app restart -n ${IDENTITY_SERVICE_APP}
         az spring app restart -n ${CATALOG_SERVICE_APP}
         az spring app restart -n ${PAYMENT_SERVICE_APP}
      ```

      ![](Images/mjv2-28-new.png)
   
   
      > **Note:** The above spring apps can take up to **7** minutes to finish restarting. Also, if any app has failed to restart, please run the above command again for that app only.

      > **Note:** If the app continues to fail, execute the command from Lab 1, Task 5, Step 3 for the associated application, and then repeat the step outlined above.

### Task 4: Get the log stream for an application

1. Run the following command to get the latest 100 lines of app console logs from the Catalog Service.

      ```shell
      az spring app logs \
          -n ${CATALOG_SERVICE_APP} \
          --lines 100
      ```

      ![](Images/mjv2-46.png)

      > **Note:** You can ignore any warning related to app logs or if the output is not expected. you can proceed to next task.

2. Run the following command by adding the `-f` parameter, so that you can get real-time log streaming from an app. Try log streaming for the Catalog Service.

      ```shell
      az spring app logs \
          -n ${CATALOG_SERVICE_APP} \
          -f
      ```
      > **Note**: This command can take up to **10-15** minutes to run successfully. You don't need to wait for the  command to get executed completely; in the meantime, you can continue with the next task.

      > **Note**: You can use `az spring app logs -h` to explore more parameters and log stream functionalities.

      > **Note:** After finishing the task, be sure not to close the Git Bash window. 

### Task 5: Start monitoring apps and dependencies - in Application Insights

  > **Note:** At this point in the workshop, only a limited number of data visualisations may be populated. (So the result and the graphs in the screenshots below may vary.)

1. Move back to the Azure portal, and in the **search resources, services and docs bar**, type **Application insight** and select it from the suggestions, as shown below: 

      ![](Images/mjv2-48.png)  

2. Under the Application Insights page, select **azure-spring-apps-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.

8. Now, from the left panel, navigate to the `Metrics` blade under Monitoring, where you can see metrics contributed by Spring Boot apps, Spring Cloud modules, and dependencies. The chart below shows `http_server_requests` and `Heap Memory Used`.

      ![](Images/mjv2-55.png)

      ![](Images/mjv2-56.png)

      > **Note:**  Spring Boot registers a lot of core metrics: JVM, CPU, Tomcat, Logback,...The Spring Boot auto-configuration enables the instrumentation of requests handled by Spring MVC. The REST controllers `ProductController`, and `PaymentController` have been instrumented by the `@Timed` Micrometer annotation at the class level.

   * `acme-catalog` application has the following custom metrics enabled:
   * @Timed: `store.products`

9. You can see these custom metrics in the `Metrics` blade:

      ![](Images/mjv2-57.png)
   
10. Now, from the left panel, navigate to the `Live Metrics` blade under Investigate - you can see live metrics on screen with low latencies < 1 second:

### Task 6: Start monitoring ACME Fitness Store's logs and metrics in Azure Log Analytics

1. In the **search resources, services and docs bar**, type **Log analytics workspace** and select it from the suggestions, as shown below: 

      ![](Images/mjv2-58.png)

2. Under the Log Analytics Workspaces page, select the **Log-analytics-workspace** which was previously created.

       | limit 500
       | sort by TimeGenerated
       | project TimeGenerated, AppName, Log
      ```

      >**Note:** If you see the message "The query was stopped", then please wait for a few minutes and try again as there might be a chance that services are still being deployed.
